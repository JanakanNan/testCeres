# Ceres growth developer test

Your goal is to **implement** *and* **deploy** a website that generates a **perfect maze** and display it on a webpage.

# Perfect maze definition

- A perfect maze is a maze with exactly one entry and one exit, 
- Every cell inside the maze is reachable
- Dead ends are permitted

# The solution

There should be 2 pages:
1. One page that asks for height and width of the maze, and uppon a click on a buttons leads to the second page.
2. The second page that displays the generated maze. If I refresh this maze, it should generate a new maze with the same dimensions.

There is no constrain on the aesthetics of the pages and of the maze, keep things simple.
The generated maze should be displayed using traditional html/css with `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>` to display cells.

The algorithm to generate the maze is one of the key part of the test, use of any library that would abstract this part would cause rejection of the application.

# Bonus

- Tests
- Readability
- Deploying it into production
